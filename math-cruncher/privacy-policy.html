            <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>
                I understand the importance of our users’ personal information, and more importantly the
                information pertaining to children under 13 years of age.
                I do NOT collect or require users to enter their personal information when using Math Cruncher app.
                I do NOT collect any personal information from children with the Math Cruncher app.
            </p>
            <p>
                I may collect general information, for example, the country you live in, how much time you spend
                in the game, mobile devices you use and similar.
                This info is NOT associated with you, I am getting it as a big pile of impersonalised numbers.
                This information helps me better understand my audience and improve the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Math Cruncher app, you may see ads. I am making sure that all ads are appropriate for
                children and that no personal information about your interactions with ads is collected.
                I am making sure I am doing everything according to COPPA and GDPR — special laws that
                are protecting your privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I may receive your non-personal data indirectly from the following third party analytics or advertisers providers. 
                Math Cruncher app uses the following ad providers to serve contextual ads in the Math Cruncher app:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Play Services: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> </li>
              <li>Unity: <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                These third parties do not share your user data; they are used to support the operation of
                the Math Cruncher app.
                Theses providers is part of the Google Play certified ad network program.
                I have enabled settings on each of these third party ad providers to ensure that no behavioural
                tracking takes place, data collected is used solely to serve contextual ads and this data is not
                shared with any other third parties. 
                All ads are subject to human review for appropriateness.
            </p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
                libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.
                If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it.
                But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is
                100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

            <h3>Links</h3>
            <p>
                This Service may contain links to other sites. I am NOT responsible for these companies and because
                I have a link doesn’t mean I endorse them. Your use of my service may be subject to the terms and
                conditions and privacy policies of other services that I don’t control such as mobile app stores,
                mobile software platforms or payment processors.
                Please be sure to check their privacy policies if you decide to visit them.
            </p>

            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                Your children are special and important. The law provides them with greater protections than adults,
                which includes their right not to have their personal data used for marketing purposes, and that they
                may delete this data at any time.
                It also grants them the right to not be subject to data collection without their specific consent. While
                under some jurisdictions, the collection of a child’s personal data is not conditioned on consent, I take
                the harsher approach and apply this condition to all jurisdictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Math Cruncher app comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). I do NOT knowingly
                contact or collect personal information from children under 13.
                If you believe I have inadvertently collected such information, please contact me so I can promptly obtain
                parental consent or remove the information.
            </p>

				of any changes by publishing the new policy on this page. Any changes
				are effective immediately on publishing and you are advised to review
