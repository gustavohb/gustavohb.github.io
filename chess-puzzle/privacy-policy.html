            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and
                libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option
                to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.
                If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            <p>
                I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service; </li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</a></li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
                Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf.
                However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                I value your trust in providing me your Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it.
                But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is
                100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

                This Service may contain links to other sites. I am NOT responsible for these companies and because
                I have a link doesn’t mean I endorse them. Your use of my service may be subject to the terms and
                conditions and privacy policies of other services that I don’t control such as mobile app stores,
                mobile software platforms or payment processors.

            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a
                child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our
                servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
                with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
            </p>
