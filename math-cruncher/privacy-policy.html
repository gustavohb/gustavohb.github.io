     <h2 id="collection">Information Collection and Use</h2>


     I understand the importance of our users’ personal information, and more importantly the information pertaining to children under 13 years of age.
     I do NOT collect or require users to enter their personal information when using Math Cruncher app.
     I do NOT collect any personal information from children with the Math Cruncher app.

     I may collect general information, for example, the country you live in, how much time you spend in the game, mobile devices you use and similar.
     This info is NOT associated with you, I am getting it as a big pile of impersonalised numbers. This information helps me better understand my audience and improve the game.

     In the Math Cruncher app, you may see ads. I am making sure that all ads are appropriate for children and that no personal information about your interactions with ads is collected.
     I am making sure I am doing everything according to COPPA and GDPR — special laws that are protecting your privacy.

     I may receive your non-personal data indirectly from the following third party analytics or advertisers providers. 
     Math Cruncher app uses the following ad provider to serve contextual ads in the Math Cruncher app. Theses networks is part of the Google Play certified ad network program.
     These networks are restricted from tracking users and serving behavioural ads; (respective privacy policies are noted below):

     </ul>

     I have enabled settings on each of these third party ad providers to ensure that no behavioural tracking takes place, data collected is used solely to serve contextual ads and this data is not shared with any other third parties. 
     All ads are subject to human review for appropriateness.

        <h2 id="children">Children’s Privacy</h2>


        Your children are special and important. The law provides them with greater protections than adults, which includes their right not to have their personal data used for marketing purposes, and that they may delete this data at any time.
        It also grants them the right to not be subject to data collection without their specific consent. While under some jurisdictions, the collection of a child’s personal data is not conditioned on consent, I take the harsher approach and apply this condition to all jurisdictions.

        The Math Cruncher app comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). I do NOT knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13.
        If you believe I have inadvertently collected such information, please contact me so I can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.


        I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        This policy is effective as of 2021-06-09
